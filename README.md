This repository contains the amplicon sequencing raw reads and the count tables obtained after the processing of the amplicon sequence data.

### Raw_sequence_data

Contains the **.fastq.gz files** with the forward and reverse reads for the V3V4 16s rDNA gene region. Also, it includes the asociated metadata file.

### Count_tables

**count_table_raw.csv**: CSV table that contains the raw count table of the ASV obtained for the V3V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene.

**count_table_rarefied.csv**: CSV table that contains the rarefied count table of the ASV obtained for the V3V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene.

**taxonomy.csv**: CSV table that contains the taxonomy annotation of each ASV sequence.

**metadata.csv**: CSV table that contains the associated information to each sample used in the SynCom experiment.

### Supplementary_information

**relative_abundance.csv**: CSV table that contains the realtive abundance of each ASV and the clasification used for Figure 3b, Figure 4 and Figure 5.
